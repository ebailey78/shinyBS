Version 0.15 (Bug Fixes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* pageWithNavBar()
  * I forgot to include the pageWithNavbar function in the NAMESPACE file so it 
    wasn't exported

* Buttons/Button Groups 
  * singletons for including shinyBS's javascript and CSS files weren't added 
    when only button functions were included in an app

* Tooltips/Popovers
  * Tooltips and Popovers will now work with the new selectize-type 
    selectInput's in shiny 0.9.0


Version 0.10 (Initial Release)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Alerts - Create alert anchors in your `ui.R` script and add alerts from 
  `server.R`

* Tooltips - Add and configure tooltips on any element with an `inputId` or 
  `outputId` with `bsTooltip()` from the ui or with `addToolTip()` from the 
  server.

* Popovers - Works the same as Tooltips but useful for more content heavy 
  applications.

* TypeAhead - Works just like a 'textInput' but you can provide custom 
  autocomplete lists to guide the user to specific inputs.

* Progress Bars - Fully configurable Progress bars that can be updated and 
  changed from `server.R`.

* Navigation Bars - Create Bootstrap style navigation bars with buttons, links,
  dropdowns, etc that control your shiny app.

* Collapse Panels - Create collapsable panels that allow you to remove some 
  clutter from your app.

* Buttons Groups - Create button groups that behave like radio buttons or 
  checkbox groups

* Buttons - Access Twitter Bootstrap styles and sizes for action buttons and 
  toggle buttons
